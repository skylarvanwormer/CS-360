Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

For the weight loss tracking app that i developed, there were three main needs. One was a data table that you could add and delete tables to. Another was a login in screen where users could make a profile if they did not have one. Lastly, the settings page that also gave the option of SMS notifications to be turned on and off. Another thing that was something needed was a user-friendly app. With that being said I made sure that it was easy to get around the app and everything was straight-forward. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

I think that the login screen, the data table, and the settings made this user-centered. Making sure that as soon as the user logged in they saw their goal weight right in front of them as long as the data table with their daily weights. In general just keeping the colors easy to the eye and making sure the app was easy to get around made my design successful.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

The biggest thing I did was take time to before I even started working o my computer write some ideas out and make sure that I have a general idea of how I want everything to be. Not to say that I won't change a couple things once the coding start, but I do like to have evreything written out and in front of me. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

The biggest way I tested my code was running it and having it come onto my phone. This was such a cool feature to have and to be able to see my app come to life on my phone. Being able to see some of the things I may not like that much once it's on my phone was so helpful.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I really struggled with having the confidence of knowing I was doing the coding right. I felt like I needed to sit down and realize that I had read the chapters and done all te research I needed to be able to make this simple app. I think that also, this was so new to me that just sitting down and rereading my notes if I needed helped me get through a lot of my challenges. 

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I think that my login page showed my knowledge, skills and experience. I think that it showed that I am capable of making a login page that also in the background goes through a database to make sure the profile trying to be logged into is made, or already existing.
